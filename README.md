Shairport Sync
=============
* Shairport Sync is an AirPlay audio player â€“ it plays audio streamed from Apple devices and from AirPlay sources such as [OwnTone](https://github.com/owntone/owntone-server) (formerly `forked-daapd`).
* Shairport Sync can be built for "classic" AirPlay 1 or limited Airplay 2 support. The AirPlay 2 build is much bigger and requires more libraries and RAM at build time and run time.

AirPlay 2
---
For the latest on AirPlay 2, please visit [AIRPLAY2.md](https://github.com/aillwee/shairport-sync/blob/development/AIRPLAY2.md).

Guides
---
* A brief guide to building classic Shairport Sync for AirPlay 1 is available at [BUILDFORAP1.md](https://github.com/aillwee/shairport-sync/blob/development/BUILDFORAP1.md).
* A guide to building Shairport Sync for AirPlay 2 on Linux is available at [BUILDFORAP2.md](https://github.com/aillwee/shairport-sync/blob/development/BUILDFORAP2.md).
* A guide for building on FreeBSD is forthcoming.

Note
---
Shairport Sync does not support AirPlay video or photo streaming.
